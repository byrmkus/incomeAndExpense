# incomeAndExpense

I developed this project with Java SE.<br/>
I used Java Swing library as user interface<br/>
I used MVC architecture structure<br/>
The database is PostgreSQL and I used Hibernate technology.<br/>
In my application, I kept the income and expenses of a person in tables and showed them graphically, and calculated the income andexpense differences according to the selected date.
