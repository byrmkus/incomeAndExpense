# incomeAndExpense

I developed this project with Java SE.
I used Java Swing library as user interface
I used MVC architecture structure
The database is PostgreSQL and I used Hibernate technology.
In my application, I kept the income and expenses of a person in tables and showed them graphically, and calculated the income andexpense differences according to the selected date.
